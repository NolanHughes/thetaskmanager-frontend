1. Add delete functionality
2. Fix bug where clicking add task when form is open adds a new task with current data. Need to have alert window to confirm that you want to discard draft and then create blank/new task.
3. Fix bug where clicking edit task while form is open changes which task you're working on but the data from previous task stays populated.
